# virat-and-toss
Virat losing toss has been a running joke for a long time and we need find a solution for it.
The solution I have thought of is quantum teleportation.
Obviously it is not a feasible solution but if it somehow becomes feasible one day, we might see ICC banning the use of it.
But this is just something fun I made to better understand teleportation algorithm.
If you feel the implementation of the teleportation algorithm in the jupyter notebook is wrong, please do tell.
